so many of yall are probably wondering "oh i wonder did he stop porting? did he die?"

hi, i'm not dead 



hi not dead i'm da-

-   so like i didn't quit porting. i port mostly on my chromebook, i don't have a real PC. i have my grandparents PC, but it's not used much. it has RTX and everything gaming wise, but i can't port on it, cause it turns my ports unoptomized. 


- and like most of the stuff i'm doing now in my sophomore year is much harder and i have less time to manage github and do school at the same time, compared to last year.


- my discord also apparently got disabled, FOR NO REASON, so i'm gonna try and create a new acc under my git, and hope it works. linking it whenever i create it. i'm still dealing with discord to figure out what happened and if i can get the acc back.


- my gf and i are still together, still figuring out whether we can sleep over again or no (and no we did not lose the thing.), cause last time we played xbox for a lot lol


- and before the discord acc got disabled, i got hacked and it sent a lot of NSFW servers spamming so heh
- reading this i now realize i worded this wrong. i got hacked, sent a lot on NSFW invites to my servers, that's what i meant.

- thanks to sanco too, just for being there

- sorry. i love you all, and i didn't mean to leave all of a sudden.
